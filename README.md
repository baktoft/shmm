# shmm
Spatial hidden Markov model

Previously, a small change in TMB was necessary (https://github.com/kaskr/adcomp/compare/mawp), however since the code was changed to utilise tinyad, this change is no longer necessary.

Installation:
```
library(devtools)
install_github("mawp/shmm/shmm")            # master branch
install_github("mawp/shmm/shmm", ref="dev") # development branch
```
